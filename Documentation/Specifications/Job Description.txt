Using a stepper motor attached to a needle valve to control the cooling water, I need the Arduino PID control code to regulate the temperature.

Hardware is Uno or Mega, one DS18B20 temperature sensor, 16x2 LCD Keypad shield, MicroStepper, 2 limit switches, 24VDC 2 Amp minimum power supply,

Keypad Shield: https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/LCD_KeyPad_Shield_For_Arduino_SKU:_DFR0009

MicroStepper: https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/TB6600_Stepper_Motor_Driver_SKU:_DRI0043

The completed unit needs to regulate the cooling water that goes to a condenser.

Settings for the desired temperature are made with the keypad buttons.

The LCD should display the desired temperature and the actual temperature.

See my short YouTube video of the project so far.
