Something that seems to confuse people about this 
project is how to control the motor with the PID code. 
They seem to think the valve must be fully On or fully Off. 
But that is not correct. When the condenser temperature 
setpoint is exceeded, the valve should open slightly. 
If still too hot, it should open a little more, and so on...

The process equipment (alcohol distiller) is best used when 
small and gradual changes are made. Even a small distiller can 
take hours for a small batch to complete. 
The limit switches are to protect the valve from closing too 
much or opening too much, as that can damage the valve.

Normally the condenser is used to cool the product that flows 
through it so cold water is added to the condenser using the valve.
But sometimes the unit is used, instead, to add heat to the system 
(controlling the temperature of a fermenter). I'd think that the Menu 
would need a "select" setting for Add Heat or Add Cold. 

The small needle valve used has approximately 10 full revolutions of turn 
from fully Off to fully On. But most of the water flow seems to happen 
during the first 4 or 5 revolutions from cracking the valve Open.
